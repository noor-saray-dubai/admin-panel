# 🔒 User Management System Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed


### 2. **API Access Restrictions** - Admin/Super Admin Only
- ❌ **Problem**: Any user with collection permissions could access user management APIs
- ✅ **Solution**: 
  - **View Users**: Only Admins and Super Admins can list/view users
  - **Create Users**: Only Admins and Super Admins can create users  
  - **Update Users**: Only Admins and Super Admins can update users
  - **Delete Users**: Only Super Admins can delete users (highest security)

### 3. **Admin Role Creation** - Super Admin Only
- ❌ **Problem**: Any admin could create other admins
- ✅ **Solution**:
  - Only Super Admins can create Admin users
  - Super Admin roles cannot be created via API (security measure)
  - Proper role hierarchy enforcement

### 4. **Comprehensive Login Audit Logging**
- ❌ **Problem**: No login timestamps or audit trails
- ✅ **Solution**: Complete login audit system with:

#### 📊 Login Success Tracking:
- ✅ Login timestamp (`lastLogin` field)
- ✅ Session duration tracking
- ✅ User role and status logging
- ✅ IP address and user agent
- ✅ Processing time metrics

#### 🚨 Login Failure Tracking:
- ✅ Failed attempt reasons (wrong password, user not found, etc.)
- ✅ Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (30 minutes)
- ✅ Suspended/deleted account access attempts
- ✅ All failed attempts logged with details

#### 🔐 Security Features:
- ✅ Account lockout mechanism
- ✅ Login attempt counting
- ✅ Status-based access control
- ✅ Comprehensive audit trail
